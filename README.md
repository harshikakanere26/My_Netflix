My_Netflix is a simple clone of Netflix, created to demonstrate how to build a modern web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project replicates the core features of Netflix, including a media-rich interface with interactive elements and responsive design. It provides a great starting point for learning how to build a streaming service-like platform.
